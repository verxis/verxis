## About Me
I’m verxis — a code craftsman, systems tinkerer, and aesthetics-driven engineer.  
By day I architect scalable systems; by night I prototype visual experiments and tune my dotfiles for optimal chaos.

- Role: Full-Stack Engineer / Systems Hacker / Open Source Enthusiast  
- Interests: Distributed systems, creative coding, synthwave music, retro gaming, terminal theming  
- Motto: Code like a hacker. Ship like a poet.

## Signature Projects
Every repo is a pocket-sized hackathon. A few highlights in the armory:
- “Project A” — turning complex real-time streams into interactive visual art  
- “Project B” — a production-ready microservices template that deploys like poetry  
- “Project C” — personal lab for AI experiments, image synthesis, and pixel-warps

Explore the repos for live demos, design notes, and battle scars.

## Quickstart (ignite the dev engine)
```bash
# Greet the world
echo "hello, world — from verxis" | lolcat

# Clone and boot my workspace (illustrative)
git clone https://github.com/verxis/verxis.git
cd verxis
make dev
```
Note: `lolcat` is optional and purely aesthetic.

---

## Open Source Philosophy
I believe software should be reproducible, well-documented, and open to collaboration. PRs, issues, and experimental forks are welcome — bring your weirdest idea.

Contribution flow:
- Fork → branch feat/your-thing → clear PR description → review → merge  
- Add tests, follow existing style, document any public API changes

## Collab & Contact
- GitHub: [verxis](https://github.com/verxis)  
- Email: hello@verxis.dev — short subject lines preferred  
- Want to hack together or pitch a collab? Open an Issue or drop a message.
